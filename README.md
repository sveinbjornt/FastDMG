# FastDMG

> "Replaces the system default DMG mounting application; is better in every way." - Some guy on the Internet

FastDMG is a macOS utility to quickly and efficiently mount `.dmg` and other disk images without any unneeded nonsense. It is a very fast and reliable replacement for Apple's hopelessly inefficient and annoying [DiskImageMounter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiskImageMounter) app.

## Features

* Doesn't waste your precious time verifying disk images
* Auto-accepts annoying end user license agreements
* Runs in the background (doesn't show up in the Dock)
* Displays no windows or menus and stays out of your way
* Multithreaded and can concurrently mount several images
* Disk image document icons continue to look the same
* Handles all disk image types supported by DiskImageMounter (dmg, iso, toast, etc.)
* Very fast native app written in Objective-C/Cocoa

FastDMG is a very minimal wrapper around the [ `hdiutil`](https://web.archive.org/web/20170506155736/https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/hdiutil.1.html) command line tool that ships with macOS. It therefore uses Apple's private DiskImages framework indirectly. It is free, open source software. I've used it for many years and it works really well. If you like it, feel free to [make a donation](https://sveinbjorn.org/donations).

## Download

*  **[â¬‡ Download FastDMG 1.0.3](https://sveinbjorn.org/files/software/FastDMG.zip)** (~1.3 MB, Universal ARM/Intel 64-bit, 10.13 or later, Developer ID signed and notarized by Apple)

If you need to run it on macOS 10.9-10.12, [version 1.0.2](https://sveinbjorn.org/files/software/fastdmg/) continues to work just fine.

## Brew

FastDMG can also be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install --cask FastDMG
```

Then:

```bash
open /Applications/FastDMG.app
```

## How to use

* Move FastDMG.app to your Applications folder
* Ctrl-click the FastDMG app and select Open to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper
* Select a `.dmg` file and press Cmd-I to show the Finder's Get Info window
* Select FastDMG under the menu item "Open with:"
* Press "Change All..."

FastDMG will then take care of mounting  `.dmg` disk images when you open them in the Finder. 
You can do the same for `.iso`, `.toast` and any other disk image formats supported by FastDMG.
